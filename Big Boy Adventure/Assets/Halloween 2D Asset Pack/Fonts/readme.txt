For UI TextElements we used TextMeshPRO (TMP) this pack is now part of free Unity packages and you can download it from assetstore or add with package manager.

We used AllerDisplay font for text and Candy Script Swash for numbers.
Both of this fonts are free and we used them in demonstrative non commercial purpose.
